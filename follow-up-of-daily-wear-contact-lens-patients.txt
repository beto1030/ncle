The average reading distance for most patients is _____ inches:14 to 16:General

During the subjective examination, you should...:Listen and document everything the patient says, selecting useful information.:Subjective

Which instrument can be used to detect warpage of a rigid contact lens?:Radiuscope or keratometer:tool

What will cause flare?:Decentration. The optical zone of the lens must cover the visual axis adequately (essentially enough to cover the pupil even when it is dilated) to prevent flare. If the optical zone is too small, the peripheral curves may intrude into the visual pathway, leading to visual disturbances such as flare.:Symptom in Rigid Lens Wear

Spherical Equivalent:All sphere power plus half the cylinder power.:General

What type of cells are visible with a fluorescein stain?:Damaged epithelial cells. Fluorescein primarily stains damaged or compromised epithelial cells on the surface of the cornea. When viewed with a cobalt blue filter, the fluorescein-stained areas appear green, highlighting the damaged regions and helping to diagnose the cause of the problem.:Fluorescein

How much change in K readings acceptable at a follow up?:0.50D:Kerotometry

Over-refracting patients wearing rigid contact lenses usually reveals little, if any:Residual Cylinder.:Rigid lens

Central corneal clouding (CCC) is a sign of:Edema.:Objective

Design feature that is useful for rotation of a front toric contact lens:Prism ballast or truncation:Lens Design

During over-refraction, the term fogging refers to...:Adding plus power to the end result to verify that it does indeed blur the vision. And to also ensure that accommodation is relaxed.:Confirm Over-refraction

Oily deposits on lens surfaces, from soap or other cosmetics, causes...:Reduced wettability.:Lens care

The follow up exam with lenses in situ should be conducted...:After 6 or more hours of wear. This will allow time for any adverse reaction to be detected.:Follow-Up and Maintenance

Spectacle blur should disappear how long after lens removal?:After 20 minutes. Spectacle blur can occur after the removal of rigid contact lenses because these lenses may temporarily alter the shape of the cornea, thereby changing its refractive power. It typically takes about 20 minutes for the cornea to return to its natural shape and for clear vision through spectacles to be restored.:Follow-Up and Maintenance

Another name for the duochrome test is the ____ test.:red/green. The red/green test is helpful in detecting minute amounts of residual hyperopia or myopia.:Contact Lens Complications and Diagnostics

Polymegathism:Is the variation of cell size in the corneal endothelium. The endothelium consists of a single layer of cells that do not regenerate, so any abnormal changes in cell number OR size due to contact lens wear is definitely cause for concern.:Contact Lens Complications and Diagnostics

What best describes the lens/cornea relationship of a properly fit soft lens?:3-point touch.:Lens Evaluation and Fitting

New blood vessels appearing in the corneal tissue is called...:Neovascularization. Retro-illumination is useful for viewing the presence of blood vessels that have invaded the cornea. Contact lens induced vascularization is one of the most frequent complications of lens wear. Most commonly seen in extended wear, sometimes in daily.:Contact Lens Complications and Diagnostics

What color is fluorescein when viewed under ultraviolet light?:Green. Fluorescein is viewed under ultraviolet light using a cobalt blue filter to show a green color.:Contact Lens Complications and Diagnostics

Spectacle blur is caused by...:Corneal changes. Contact lenses, typically rigid contact lenses, may alter the shape of the cornea temporarily for 20 mins.:Contact Lens Complications and Diagnostics

Which type of lens is used to correct residual astigmatism?:Toric lenses. For low to moderate astigmatism, front surface toric lenses are often sufficient and are commonly used in soft contact lenses. For high astigmatism, back surface toric lenses or custom RGP lenses may provide more precise correction and better stability.:Lens Power and Optics

Epithelial thinning is a result of...:Decreased cell mitosis. This is a fundamental concept in biology. Mitosis is a critical process in eukaryotic cells that ensures the equal distribution of genetic material to two daughter cells. Proper regulation of mitosis is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair.:Lens Power and Optics

Quality of lens surfaces should be evaluated by the fitter on or off the eye?:Both on and off the eye. While the lenses are on the eye we check for centration, movement, lens surface, lens/cornea relationship. While the lenses are removed we check for corneal integrity and giant papillary conjunctivitis.:Lens Evaluation and Fitting

Some contact lens problems may be related to...:Using the wrong solutions, a dirty case, or patient-non-compliance.:Follow-Up and Maintenance
